  //This class serves as a repository for all elements, including third-party components, that are deemed unnecessary. By storing these elements here, 
  //they can be efficiently excluded during runtime execution. 
  //This approach allows for dynamic optimization of the program's performance by omitting non-essential elements when the application is running.
